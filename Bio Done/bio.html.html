  <h1>About Liam</h1>
  <p> I really enjoy putting together computers and learning more and more about programming,
    combined with playing with my dog.</p>
  <p> Programming has only really become an interest of mine in recent years but throughout
    this time i have learnt a fair amount including HTML and Java. Throughout the early stages of
    learning i found it really difficult to do the basics, however now i am fairly familiar with
    both.</p>
   <p> Assembling computers is always fun especially when starting from scratch with cheap and old
  parts, making you feel as if you accomplished something at the end of the creation.</p>
   <p> When im not doing either of these i will more than likely be playing games with friends, i feel
    like its good to get a break from the coding so you dont get bored of it too quickly.</p>
    <p>Currently I study at the University of Northampton, studying Computing.</p>
